\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we introduce a python library to facilitate Jyotiṣa computations, as well as associated but independent festival and event repositories. This library may be used to compute highly customized Hindu calendars, and has been successfully used to determine dates of historical events.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Jyotisha \cite{jyotisha_py} is an open source python package to do panchāṅga (traditional vedic astronomical / astrological) calculations, and produce calendars in various formats. It is backed by big events databases, stored in the open source ``adyatithi" repository \cite{adyatithi}. In this paper, we present some major features of this package, as well as present the associated festival and events databases (which may be used with other Jyotiṣa libraries as well).
